            Reservation is the beating heart of Indian politics. UP assembly state
            elections 2017 are to take place starting February second week. UP, the
            biggest state of India. With a massive population of 20.45 crores this
            state is the deciding factor of who wins in the general elections. Out
            of the 20.45 crores therein lies only 23% of open class citizens,
            13 percent Muslims and the remaining are either sc, st or obc(do the math).
